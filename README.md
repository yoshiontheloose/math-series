## Overview

Using either recursion or iteration, implement functions for the Fibonacci Series and Lucas Numbers to find the nth value.

The Fibonacci Series is a numeric series starting with the integers 0 and 1. In this series, the next integer is determined by summing the previous two. This gives us:

``` markdown
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
```

Note When asking for the nth number in series presume starting at zero.

> fibonacci(0) == 0, fibonacci(1) == 1, fibonacci(2) == 1, etc.

The Lucas Numbers are a related series of integers that start with the values 2 and 1 rather than 0 and 1. The resulting series looks like this:

``` markdown
2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, ...
```

## Getting Started

Create a module and test file. Utilize Poetry environment and Pytest.

Write tests first, then implement code.

Run tests to check functionality

---

## Architecture

Python, Poetry, pytest
